I definitely kill them
Kilata, baby1
Gery-Nikol, mama
I definitely kill them, I blow them away!
 
I definitely kill them, I blow them away!
Put your glasses up in the air,
let the dzun-dzun2 sound!
The party is high with you, cool until the end -
I want you, you make me feel in the best way!
 
My mind leaves my body, I want to blow off steam
we've lightened cigars and champagne is being poured
You call the subscriber3, but there is no connection
I want a bottle of vodka, either Russian or Grey Goose
Kilata kills them again, and the Gery's back blows them away, under the belt
The hate motivates my big fat wad
To have a great network and to move only your finger4
and in front of the garage is waiting my shiny phantom5
 
Gym, I go in, I lift, I exercise
Camera, action, I film, I blow them away
You don't even hear me, and I'll tear the chain apart6
The one that's crazy about me wants me a lot

I definitely kill them, I blow them away!
Put your glasses up in the air,
let the dzun-dzun sound!
The party is high with you, cool until the end -
I want you, you make me feel in the best way!
 
You want me, I know it, babe.
You watch only me now, yeah, yeah
And I can't be just with you, babe
I want to understand everything
 
You're the one who stops
I'm the one who annoys people7
You're the one who's staring
I mean exactly you
The Cadillac has been parked, madafaka
Nobody could assume what is being planned and what will happen
You're the one who is obedient
I'm the one who will smoke
That you woman is underneath the shower and I'll destroy her make up8
You're a blocked subscriber
I'm the one who copies
that wants to comment, the people understand me the best
 
#thecoolass9, bro!
I jump on the wave10, I make the whole city stand up!11
The biggest bro Kilata lifts his bag full of money
after that we're going to a party, bro
We're the bees, mom, bees in the trap
A funk from Varna12 mixed with gangsta rap
The little princess and Kilata delight
We burn the night and the party is all night
 
/x2/
I definitely kill them, I blow them away!
Put your glasses up in the air,
let the dzun-dzun sound!
The party is high with you, cool until the end -
I want you, you make me feel in the best way!
 
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best
I'm the best, give it to all (female) students13
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best
Come on, draw it bro, we're all (female) students14
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best
I'm the best, give it to all (female) students
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best
We burn the night and the party is all night
 
Put your glasses up in the air to... dzun-dzun
Put your glasses up in the air to... dzun-dzun
Dzun-dzun, dzun-dzun

Come on, draw it bro, we're all (female) students
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best
I'm the best, give it to all (female) students
I'm the best, you're the best, everyone is the best

One, two, three
I definitely kill them
I roll with Kilata15
Kilata, baby
Puff-paff16
Puff and puff and paff
